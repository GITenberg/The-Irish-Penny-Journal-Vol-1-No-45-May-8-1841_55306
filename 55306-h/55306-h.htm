<p>No individual of the canine race has attained an equal amount
of fame, or excited an equal degree of attention through Europe,
not merely in the days of his acknowledged existence
amongst our dogs of chase, but even now, that he is considered
to be extinct, with that once possessed by the superb
creature whose picture adorns our title-page, and an account
of whom forms the subject of the present article. Public opinion
has long been divided respecting the precise appearance
and form of this majestic animal, and so many different ideas
have been conceived of him, that many persons have been induced
to come to the conclusion that no particular breed of
dogs was ever kept for wolf-hunting in this country, but that
the appellation of “wolf-dog” was bestowed upon any dog
swift enough to overtake and powerful enough to contend
with and overcome that formidable animal. There are those
who hold this opinion, and there are likewise those who hold
that while a particular breed was used, it was a sort of heavy
mastiff-like dog, now extinct. It is the object of the present
paper to show that not only did Ireland possess a peculiar
race of dogs exclusively devoted to wolf-hunting, but that
those dogs, instead of being of the mastiff kind, resembled
the greyhound in form; and instead of being extinct, are still
to be met with, although we are compelled to acknowledge
that they are very scarce. I myself was once in very gross
error respecting this dog, for I like many others conceived him
to have been a mastiff, and implicitly believed that the dogs of
Lord Altamont, described in the 3d vol. of the Linnæan Transactions
by Mr Lambert, were the sole surviving representatives
of the Irish wolf-dog. An able and talented paper, read
by Mr A. Haffield of this city, about a year ago, before the
Dublin Natural History Society, served to stagger me in my
belief, and subsequent careful inquiry and research have completed
my conversion. I proceed to lay before my readers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
result of that inquiry, and I feel confident that no individual
after reading the evidences which I shall adduce, will continue
to harbour a doubt respecting the true appearance and
form of the ancient Irish wolf-dog.</p>

<p>We are informed by such disjointed scraps of Celtic verse
as Time, that merciless destroyer, has suffered to come down,
though in a mutilated form, to our days, that in the times of
old, when Fionn Mac Cumbaill, popularly styled Fin Mac Cool,
wielded the sceptre of power and of justice, we possessed a
prodigious and courageous dog used for hunting the deer and
the wild boar, with, though last not least, the grim and savage
wolf which ravaged the folds and slaughtered the herds
of our ancestors. We learn from the same source that these
dogs were also frequently employed as auxiliaries in war, and
that they were “mighty in combat, their breasts like plates
of brass, and greatly to be feared.” We might adduce the
songs of Ossian, but that we fear to draw upon ourselves the
envious rancour of some snarling critic. We cannot, however,
avoid observing, that the epithets “hairy-footed,” “white-breasted,”
and “bounding,” are singularly characteristic of
some of the striking peculiarities of the dog in question, and
strangely coincide with the descriptions furnished by other
writers respecting him; so that M’Pherson must at all events
have been at the pains of considerable research if he actually
forged the beautiful poems which he put forth to the world
under Ossian’s name. The word “Bran,” the name given to
Fingal’s noble hound, employed by others than Ossian, or I
should not mention it, is Celtic, and signifies “mountain
torrent,” implying that impetuosity of course and headlong
courage so characteristic of the subject of my paper. I have
said that many assert the Irish wolf-dog to be no longer in
existence. I have ventured a denial of this, and refer to the
wolf-dog or deer-dog of the Highlands of Scotland as his
actual and faithful living representative. Perhaps I am wrong
in saying “representative.” I hold that the Irish wolf-dog
and the Highland deer-dog are one and the same; and I now
proceed to cite a few authorities in support of my positions.</p>

<p>The venerable Bede, as well as the Scotch historian John
Major, informs us that Scotland was originally peopled from
Ireland under the conduct of Reuda, and adds, that even in his
own days half Scotland spoke the Irish language as their mother
tongue; and many of my readers are doubtless aware that even
at this present time the Gaelic and the Erse are so much alike
that a Connaught man finds no difficulty in comprehending
and conversing with a Highlander, and I myself have read
the Gaelic Bible with an Irish dictionary. Scotland also was
called by the early writers Scotia Minor, and Ireland Scotia
Major. The colonization, therefore, of Scotland from Ireland,
admits of little doubt. As the Irish wolf-dog was at that
time in the enjoyment of his most extended fame, it was not
to be expected that the colonists would omit taking with them
such a fine description of dog, and which would prove so
useful to them in a newly established settlement, and that too
at a period when hunting was not merely an amusement, but
one of their main occupations, and their main source of subsistence.
The Irish wolf-dog was thus carried into Scotland
and became the Highland or Scottish wolf-dog, changing in
process of time his name with his country; and in the course
of ages when the wolves died out of the land, his occupation
being no longer the hunting of those animals but of deer, he
became known no longer as the Highland wolf-dog, but as the
Highland deer-dog, though indeed he is to the present called
by the former of these appellations by many writers both
Irish and Scottish. In Ireland the wolves were in existence
longer than in Scotland; but as soon as the wolves ceased to
exist in this country, the dogs were suffered to become extinct
also, while in Scotland there was still abundant employment
for them after the days of wolf-hunting were over, for the
deer still remained; and useful as they had been as wolf-dogs,
they proved themselves if possible more so as deer-hounds.
That the Irish wolf-dog was a tall rough greyhound, similar
in every respect to the Highland dog of the present day, I
beg to adduce in proof the following authorities:&mdash;Strabo
mentions a tall greyhound in use among the Pictish and Celtic
nations, which he states was held in high esteem by our ancestors,
and was even imported into Gaul for the purposes of the
chase. Campion expressly speaks of the Irish wolf-dog as a
“greyhound of great bone and limb.” Silaus calls it also a
greyhound, and asserts that it was imported into Ireland by
the Belgæ, and is the same with the renowned Belgic dog
of antiquity, and that it was, during the days of Roman grandeur,
brought to Rome for the combats of the amphitheatre.
Pliny relates a combat in which the Irish wolf-dogs took a part;
he calls them “Canes Graii Hibernici,” and describes them as
much taller than the mastiff. Hollinshed, in speaking of the
Irish, says, “They are not without wolves, and greyhounds
to hunt them.” Evelyn, speaking of the bear-garden, says,
“The bull-dogs did exceeding well, but the Irish wolf-dog exceeded,
which was a tall greyhound, a stately creature, and
beat a cruel mastiff.”</p>

<p>Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, was presented by King John
with a specimen of this kind of dog, “the greyhound, the
greathound, the graceful of limb;” and most of my readers
are familiar with that beautiful poem, the “Grave of the Greyhound.”
These animals were in those days permitted to be
kept only by princes and chiefs; and in the Welch laws of
the ninth century we find heavy penalties laid down for the
maiming or injuring of the Irish greyhound, or, as it was
styled in the code alluded to, “Canis Graius Hibernicus;”
and a value was set upon them, equal to more than double
that set on the ordinary greyhound.</p>

<p>Moryson, secretary to Lord Deputy Mountjoy, says, “The
Irishmen and greyhounds are of great stature.” Lombard
says that the finest hunting dogs in Europe were produced in
Ireland: “Greyhounds useful to take the stag, wild boar, or
wolf.” Pennant describes these dogs as scarce, and as being
led to the chase in leather slips or thongs, and calls them the
“Irish greyhound.” Ray describes him as the “greatest
dog” he had ever seen. Buffon says he saw an “Irish greyhound”
which measured five feet in height when in a sitting
posture, and says that all other sorts of greyhounds are descended
from him, and that <em>in Scotland it is called the Highland
greyhound</em>, that it is very large, deep chested, and
covered with long rough hair.</p>

<p>Scottish noblemen were not always content with such
specimens of this dog as their own country produced, but frequently
sent for them to Ireland, conceiving doubtless that they
would be found better and purer in their native land. The following
is a copy of a letter addressed by Deputy Falkland
to the Earl of Cork in 1623:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="salutation">“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I have lately received letters from my Lord Duke of Buccleuch
and others of my noble friends, who have entreated
me to send them some greyhound dogs and bitches out of this
kingdom, of the largest sort, which I perceive they intend to
present unto divers princes and other noble persons; and if
you can possibly, let them be white, which is the colour most
in request here. Expecting your answer by the bearer, I
commit you to the protection of the Almighty, and am</p>

<p class="center">Your lordship’s attached friend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Falkland</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Smith, in the second edition of his History of Waterford,
says, “The Irish greyhound is nearly extinct: it is much taller
than a mastiff, but more like a greyhound, and for size, strength,
and shape, cannot be equalled. Roderick, King of Connaught,
was obliged to furnish hawks and greyhounds to Henry II.
Sir Thomas Rue obtained great favour from the Great Mogul
in 1615 for a brace of Irish greyhounds presented by him.
Henry VIII. presented the Marquis of Dessarages, a Spanish
grandee, with two goshawks and four Irish greyhounds.”</p>

<p>I have now adduced, I think, a sufficient number of authorities
to demonstrate the identity of the Irish wolf-dog
with the Highland deer-hound. I might adduce many more,
but want of space prevents my doing so. I may however,
ere concluding, take the liberty of extracting from the excellent
paper of Mr Haffield, already alluded to as having
been read before the Dublin Natural History Society, the
following communication, received by that gentleman from
Sir William Betham, Ulster King at Arms, an authority of
very high importance on any subject connected with Irish antiquities.
Sir William says:&mdash;“From the mention of the wolf-dogs
in the old Irish poems and stories, and also from what
I have heard from a very old person, long since dead, of his
having seen them at the Neale, in the county of Mayo, the
seat of Sir John Browne, ancestor to Lord Kilmaine, I have
no doubt they were a gigantic greyhound. My departed
friend described them as being very gentle, and that Sir J.
Browne allowed them to come into his dining-room, where they
put their heads over the shoulders of those who sat at table:
they were not smooth-skinned like our greyhounds, but rough
and curly-haired. The Irish poets call the wolf-dog ‘Cu,’
and the common hound ‘Gayer;’ a marked distinction, the
word ‘Cu’ signifying a champion.”</p>

<p>The Highland or Irish wolf-dog is a stately majestic animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
extremely good tempered and quiet in his disposition unless
when irritated or excited, when he becomes furious, and is, in
consequence of his tremendous strength, a truly formidable
animal. The size of these dogs has been much exaggerated.
Goldsmith asserts that he saw several, some of which were
four feet high! We cannot of course credit this, but there is
no doubt that they were larger than most other dogs, and indeed
the Highland deer-hound is now the tallest dog in existence.</p>

<p>This animal is nearly extinct. Even Glengarry, whose
dogs were once so famous, has not one genuine specimen
left, and but a few remain scattered here and there through
the north of Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. Mr
Nolan’s dog “Oscar,” whose portrait heads this article, is the
finest specimen of the kind I have ever seen, standing 28½
inches in height at the shoulders; their average height in
their very best days seems to have been about 30 inches. The
colour of these dogs varies, but the most esteemed are dark
iron-grey, with white breast. This is the colour of Oscar.
They are, however, to be found of a yellowish or sandy hue,
brindled, and even white. In former times, as will be seen
from Lord Falkland’s letter quoted above, this latter colour
was by many preferred. One of the most remarkable
facts respecting the size of this dog, is the great disparity
which exists between the sizes of the male and female of the
breed, many of the latter being very diminutive, while their
male offspring invariably attain the full stature of its race.
Why will not some of our Irish gentlemen and sportsmen
turn their attention to this splendid breed of dogs, and seek
to prevent, ere it be too late, its total extirpation?</p>

<p>Now, readers, there may be some among you who have
thought my paper somewhat dry and prosy; and in case you
should forget the many times I have amused you before, and
cast me forth altogether from your good graces, I shall conclude
with an authentic statement of how the last wolves existing
in the county Tyrone were destroyed by means of the
Irish greyhound; my account is taken from a biography of a
Tyrone family published in Belfast in 1829. I thus venture
to abridge the note to page 74.</p>

<p>In the mountainous parts of the county Tyrone the inhabitants
suffered much from the wolves, and gave from the
public fund as much for the head of one of these animals as
they would now give for the capture of a notorious robber on
the highway. There lived in those days an adventurer, who,
alone and unassisted, made it his occupation to destroy these
ravagers. The time for attacking them was in the night,
and midnight was the best time for doing so, as that was
their wonted time for leaving their lair in search of food,
when the country was at rest and all was still; then issuing
forth, they fell on their defenceless prey, and the carnage
commenced. There was a species of dog for the purpose of
hunting them, called the wolf-dog; the animal resembled a
rough, stout, half-bred greyhound, but was much stronger.
In the county Tyrone there was then a large space of ground
inclosed by a high stone wall, having a gap at each of the
two opposite extremities, and in this were secured the flocks
of the surrounding farmers. Still, secure though this fold was
deemed, it was entered by the wolves, and its inmates slaughtered.
The neighbouring proprietors having heard of the
noted wolf-hunter above mentioned, by name Rory Carragh,
sent for him, and offered the usual reward, with some addition,
if he would undertake to destroy the two remaining
wolves that had committed such devastation. Carragh undertaking
the task, took with him two wolf-dogs, and a little boy
only twelve years old, the only person who would accompany
him, and repaired at the approach of midnight to the fold in
question. “Now,” said Carragh to the boy, “as the two
wolves usually enter the opposite extremities of the sheep-fold
at the same time, I must leave you and one of the dogs
to guard this one while I go to the other. He steals with all
the caution of a cat, nor will <em>you</em> hear him, but the <em>dog</em> will,
and positively will give him the first fall; if, therefore, you
are not active when he is down to rivet his neck to the ground
with this spear, he will rise up and kill both you and the dog.
So good night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I can,” said the little boy, as he took the
spear from the wolf-hunter’s hand.</p>

<p>The boy immediately threw open the gate of the fold, and
took his seat in the inner part, close to the entrance; his faithful
companion crouching at his side, and seeming perfectly
aware of the dangerous business he was engaged in. The
night was very dark and cold, and the poor little boy being
benumbed with the chilly air, was beginning to fall into a kind
of sleep, when at that instant the dog with a roar leaped
across him, and laid his mortal enemy upon the earth. The
boy, was roused into double activity by the voice of his
companion, and drove the spear through the wolf’s neck as he
had been directed, at which time Carragh appeared, bearing
the head of the other.</p>

<p>I have not been able to ascertain with certainty the date of
the death of the last Irish wolf, but there was a presentment
for killing wolves granted in Cork in the year 1710. I am at
present acquainted with an old gentleman between 80 and 90
years of age, whose mother remembered wolves to have been
killed in the county of Wexford about the year 1730-40; and
it is asserted by many persons of weight and veracity that a
wolf was killed in the Wicklow mountains so recently as
1770. I have other legends on the subject of wolf-hunting in
Ireland in former times, but want of space compels me, for
the present at all events, to conclude, which I do, trusting
that what I have already written will gratify my readers.</p>

<p>An ancient Irish harp, popularly known as the harp of
Brian Boriumha, still preserved in Trinity College, Dublin,
is ornamented with a figure of the wolf-dog, which, as representing
him under the form of a rough strong greyhound,
precisely similar to the animal now known as the Highland
deer-hound, furnishes an additional argument to the correctness
of the position above advanced.</p>

<p class="right">H. D. R.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Mosaic Work.</span>&mdash;The art of mosaic work has been known
in Rome since the days of the republic. The severer rulers
of that period forbade the introduction of foreign marbles,
and the republican mosaics are all in black and white. Under
the empire the art was greatly improved, and not merely by
the introduction of marbles of various colours, but by the invention
of artificial stones, termed by the Italians <i lang="it">smalti</i>,
which can be made of every variety of tint. This art was
never entirely lost. On the introduction of pictures into
Christian temples, they were first made of mosaic; remaining
specimens of these are rude, but profoundly interesting in a
historical point of view. When art was restored in Italy,
mosaic also was improved, but it attained its greatest perfection
in the last and present century. Roman mosaic, as now practised,
may be described as being the production of pictures
by connecting together numerous minute pieces of coloured
marble or artificial stones; these are attached to a ground of
copper by means of a strong cement of gum mastic, and other
materials, and are afterwards ground and polished as a stone
would be to a perfectly level surface; by this art not only are
ornaments made on a small scale, but pictures of the largest
size are copied. In former times the largest cupolas of churches,
and not unfrequently the entire walls, were encrusted with mosaic.
The most remarkable modern works are the copies
which have been executed of some of the most important
works of the great masters for the altars in St Peter’s.
These are in every respect perfect imitations of the originals;
and when the originals, in spite of every care, must change
and perish, these mosaics will still convey to distant ages a
perfect idea of the triumphs of art achieved in the fifteenth
century. The government manufactory in Rome occupies the
apartments in the Vatican which were used as offices of the
Inquisition. No copies are now made, but cases of <i lang="it">smalti</i> are
shown, containing, it is said, 18,000 different tints. Twenty
years were employed in making one of the copies I have mentioned.
The pieces of mosaic vary in size from an eighth to
a sixteenth of an inch, and eleven men were employed for that
time on each picture. A great improvement was introduced
into the art in 1775 by the Signor Raffaeli, who thought of preparing
the <i lang="it">smalti</i> in what may be termed fine threads. The
pastes or <i lang="it">smalti</i> are manufactured at Venice in the shape of
crayons, or like sticks of sealing-wax, and are afterwards drawn
out by the workman at a blow-pipe, into the thickness he requires,
often almost to a hair, and now seldom thicker than
the finest grass stalk. For tables and large articles, of
course, the pieces are thicker; but the beauty of the workmanship,
the soft gradation of the tints, and the cost, depend
upon the minuteness of the pieces, and the skill displayed by
the artist. A ruin, a group of flowers or figures, will employ
a good artist about two months when only two inches square,
and a specimen of such a description costs from £5 to £20,
according to the execution; a landscape, six inches by four,
would require eighteen months, and would cost from forty to
fifty pounds. This will strike you as no adequate remuneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
for the time bestowed. The finest ornaments for a lady,
consisting of necklace, ear-rings, and brooch, cost forty pounds.
For a picture of Paestum, eight feet long, and twenty inches
broad, on which four men were occupied for three years, £1,000
sterling was asked.</p>

<p>I shall now notice the mosaic work of Florence. It differs
entirely from Roman mosaic, being composed of stones inserted
in comparatively large masses; it is called work in <em lang="it">pietra
dura</em>. The stones used are all more or less of a rare
and precious nature. In old specimens the most beautiful
works are those in which the designs are of an arabesque character.
The most remarkable specimen of this description of
pietra dura is an octagonal table in the <em lang="it">Gubinetto di Baroccio</em>,
in the Florence Gallery. It is valued at £20,000 sterling,
and was commenced in 1623 by Jacopo Detelli, from designs
by Ligozzi. Twenty-two artists worked upon it without
interruption till it was terminated in the year 1649. Attempts
at landscapes, and the imitation of natural objects,
were usually failures in former times, mere works of labour,
which did not attain their object; but of late works have
been produced in this art, in which are represented groups of
flowers and fruit, vases, musical instruments, and other compatible
objects, with a truth and beauty which excite the utmost
admiration and surprise. These pictures in stone are,
however, enormously expensive, and can only be seen in the
palaces of the great. Two tables in the Pilazzo Pitti are
valued at £7,000, and this price is by no means excessive.
These are of modern design, on a ground of porphyry, and
ten men were employed for four years on one of them, and a
spot is pointed out, not more than three inches square, on
which a man had worked for ten months. But Florentine
mosaic, like that of Rome, is not merely used for cabinets,
tables, or other ornamental articles; the walls of the spacious
chapel which is used as the burial-place of the reigning family
at Florence are lined with pietra dura, realising the gem-encrusted
halls of the Arabian tales. Roman mosaic, as we
have seen, is of great value as an ally to art; but Florentine
mosaic can have no such pretensions, and time and money
might be better bestowed. The effect is far from pleasing in
the chapel I have alluded to, and I think that the art might
be advantageously confined to the production of small ornaments,
for which it is eminently adapted.&mdash;<cite>The Civil Engineer

<h2 class="gap4">SEALS OF IRISH CHIEFS.</h2>

<p class="center">An Essay read at a Meeting of the Royal Irish Academy,
by George Petrie, R.H.A., M.R.I.A.</p>

<p>Having a few months since succeeded in deciphering an
ancient and somewhat difficult inscription on the seal of a
distinguished Irish chief, which the Dean of St Patrick’s had but
just previously added to his magnificent collection of our national
antiquities, it occurred to me that a notice of this seal,
and of a few others of the same class, preserved in that collection
and in my own, might be somewhat interesting to the
Academy, and at the same time prove useful in showing the
importance of forming collections of this kind. In an assembly
so enlightened as that which I have the honour to address,
it would be impertinent to offer any remarks on the value of
ancient seals, not only as evidences of the truth of history,
both local and national, but also as illustrations of the state
and progress of the arts in times past. As has been justly
remarked, it is from the great seals of England that we have
been supplied with the surest criteria for estimating the progressive
advancements made in architectural taste, and the
various successive phases which it has from time to time exhibited
in the country; and if all other historical evidences
were lost, this alone would perhaps be sufficient to compensate
for the want. The importance of this branch of archæology
has indeed been felt and acknowledged in every other country
of Europe, in proportion to the progress which it has made
in civilization and refinement; and we should perhaps feel
some mortification at being necessitated to confess that in
Ireland alone it has hitherto received scarcely any attention.
I shall not say that this neglect on the part of our antiquaries
has arisen from a distaste for investigations which, as
they require merely a little learning and common sense, allow
no indulgence for the mind to soar into the dim and distant
upper regions of romance and fanciful conjecture, where such
qualities would be found but weighty and earthly incumbrances.
A sufficient reason may be found in the fact, that until
very recently there were no collections of antiquities of this
class in existence to which investigators could refer; and
hence, if the Irish antiquary had been only a few years back
asked the question whether the Irish ever had the use of signets
commonly among them, he would have been constrained
to confess his inability to give an answer. Such a question,
however, can be replied to now in a more satisfactory manner.
It is ascertained that not only the Irish kings and petty
princes, from the period of the Anglo-Norman conquest,
used signets, but also that they were common among persons
of inferior rank. It can be also shown that such signets closely
resembled in style and device those of the Anglo-Normans of
similar ranks. Still, however, from the imperfection consequent
on the recent formation of our collections of antiquities, the
era at which seals began to be used in Ireland remains undecided;
for although we have no seals of an earlier age than the
thirteenth century, it would be as yet premature to conclude
that none such ever existed. Till a recent period it was the
opinion of the English antiquaries generally that the use of
signets was unknown to the Saxons, and was introduced into
England by the Normans; and this opinion was grounded on
the fact that no Saxon seals had ever been discovered. But
of late years there have been found seals, unquestionably of
the Saxon times; and no doubt can now be reasonably entertained
of their general use among that people; and hence,
although no seals of cotemporaneous with the Saxon times have
as yet been met with in Ireland, the similarity that prevailed
between the two countries in customs, and in knowledge of the
arts, would very strongly warrant the conclusion that the use
of signets could not have been unknown or perhaps uncommon
in Ireland.</p>

<p>To these prefatory remarks I have only to add, that though
the use of signets was common not only among the Greeks
and Romans, but also among the earlier civilized nations of
the East, we have no evidence that such a use had ever been
introduced into Ireland by its original colonists.</p>

<p>With these few general introductory observations I shall
now proceed to exhibit to the Academy the seals which it appeared
to me desirable to bring under their notice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/seal1.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="Drawing of the seal of Felim O’Conor" />
</div>

<p>The first, unfortunately, I can only exhibit in a drawing, as
the original is not now known to exist. It is the seal of Felim
O’Conor, who was allowed by the English government to bear
the hereditary title of king of Connaught in the thirteenth
century, and the legend is <cite>S. Fedlimid Regis Conactie</cite>.
The impression of this seal has been published in Ware’s
Antiquities, where it is adduced as an evidence that some
of the Irish chiefs retained the title of king subsequently
to the Anglo-Norman conquest. The following is the passage
in which the statement occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thus far the kings of Ireland, who lived before the arrival
of the English under King Henry II, but even after that
period, some, though subjects, enjoyed the regal title, and
were styled kings even by the kings of England. For Hoveden
cites the following passage under the year 1175. <cite>Hic est
Finis et Concordia</cite>, &amp;c. ‘This is the final end and concord,
which was made at Windsor on the octaves of St Michael in
the year of grace 1175, between our Lord Henry king of
England, son of the Empress Maude, and Roderick king of
Connaught, by Catholicus, Archbishop of Tuam, and Cantord,
Abbot of St Brendan, and Master Laurence, chancellor of
the king of Conaught, viz., that the king of England grants
to the said Roderick, his liege man, king of Conaught, that
as long as he shall faithfully serve him, he shall be king under
him, ready to do him service as liege man, &amp;c.’ The letters
patent of king Henry II, by which he committed the management
of his Irish affairs to William Fitz-Adelm, his
sewer, shew us the rank in which these nominal kings were at
that time placed. They begin thus: ‘<i lang="la">Henricus</i>, &amp;c. Henry
by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke
of Normandy and Aquitain, and earl of Anjou, to the archbishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
bishops, <span class="smcapuc">KINGS</span>, earls, barons, and to all his faithful
subjects of Ireland, greeting.’ It appears also out of the
close roll An. 6th of king John in the Tower of London, that
the successor of Roderick was in like manner called king of
Conaught. So in the close roll of the 5th of Henry III,
some of the king’s letters patent were directed, among others
to K. king of Conaught, and to O. king of Kinel-ean; and
in the following year the same king granted to the king
of Tosmond the land of Tosmond. For thus it is in the charter
roll of the 6th of Henry III, Membr. 2, ‘<i lang="la">Rex</i>, &amp;c.
The king to the king of Tosmond, greeting. We grant unto
you the land of Tosmond, (<i>i. e.</i> Thumond) which you formerly
held at the farm of 130 marks, to be held of us until we come of
age.’ Concerning the suit exhibited at London by Fedlimid
O’Conor before K. Henry III. and his court, see Matthew
Paris under the year 1140, where that writer calls him
‘<cite>Petty King of that part of <span class="upright">Ireland</span>, which is called <span class="upright">Cunnoch</span></cite>,
<i>i. e.</i> Conaught;’ and that Fedlimid himself took upon him the
name of king of Connaught, appears from his seal, the impression
of which is exhibited to the reader, plate 1, No. 3.&mdash;[It
appears by the Lord Stafford’s letters (<i>c.</i>) that the seal here
mentioned was presented to King Charles I. in the year 1636.]”</p>

<p>From the letter here alluded to, which was addressed to
Lord Stafford by Secretary Cooke in 1636, it appears that
this seal was presented by Sir Beverley Newcomen to the king
in person, by whom, as the letter states, the seal was much esteemed,
and well accepted. As this seal is not known to exist
at present, it may be supposed that it was lost in the civil wars
which followed so soon afterwards.</p>

<p>As the life of Felim O’Conor constitutes a portion of the
general history of Ireland, it is unnecessary for me to advert
more in detail to it, than to mention that he was elected to the
throne of Connaught, by the English of that province in 1230,
was deposed by them in 1232, was restored again soon afterwards,
died in 1265, and was interred in the abbey of Roscommon,
where a magnificent tomb was raised over his remains,
which is still to be seen. His death is thus recorded in the Annals
of the Four Masters:&mdash;“1265. Felim, the son of Charles
the red-handed O’Conor, defender and supporter of his own
province and of his friends on every side; expeller and plunderer
of his enemies; a man full of hospitality, valour, and renown;
patron of the orders of the clergy and of men of science;
worthy heir to the throne of Ireland for his nobility, justice
and valour, wisdom, personal shape, and love of truth; died
after extreme unction and penance, in the monastery of the
Dominican Friars at Roscommon, which he himself had
granted to God and that order.”</p>

<p>It will be observed that the style and device of this seal are
very similar to those of the Norman and Anglo-Norman seals
of the same age; and it can scarcely admit of doubt that its
type was derived from that source. As to its general form,
we have no description left; but a nearly cotemporary seal of a
king of Desmond, which I have now the honour to exhibit
will probably enable the Academy to form an accurate idea of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/seal2.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="Drawing of the seal of Donald Og, king of Desmond" />
</div>

<p>This seal, which is from my own cabinet, is, as the inscription
shows, the seal of Donald Og, the son of Donald Roe
Mac Carthy, who, as appears from the notices in the Irish and
English authorities, became king or lord of Desmond by the
murder of his father, Donald Roe, in 1306, or, as some accounts
state, in 1302, and was himself killed in 1309. The
legend runs thus:&mdash;<cite>S. Dovenaldi: Og: Fili: D: Roth MaCarthy</cite>.
The name of this prince appears in the pedigree
of the Mac Carthy family as fifteenth in ascent from the
last Earl of Clancarty and the thirtieth in descent from their
great ancestor Oilioll Olum. It will be seen that its device
is very similar to that of the king of Connaught, but the form
of the letters in the inscription indicates a somewhat later
age. This seal was found about twenty years ago in the
county of Cork, and was purchased originally by a watch-maker
in that city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/seal3.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt="Drawing of the seal of Mac Con" />
</div>

<p>The next seal that I have the honour to exhibit is from the
collection of the Dean of St Patrick’s, and is that to which I
made allusion at the commencement of this paper. It was
discovered by that zealous collector among some old silver in
a jeweller’s shop. In its general features it is similar to the
seals already noticed, but the character of the letters in the
legend indicate a still later age; and this circumstance, unimportant
as it may appear, is of consequence, as it enables us
with certainty to determine its owner, which would otherwise
have been with difficulty ascertained, as there were two chiefs
of the name in the legend in the family to which it belongs.
The inscription on this seal reads thus:&mdash;<cite>Si. Mac Con,
ducis de Ui Cassin</cite>. The territory called Hy-Caissin comprehended
a considerable tract of the ancient Thomond in
the county of Clare, of which the Macnamaras were hereditary
lords; and the Mac Con whose name appears on this seal
is found in all the pedigrees of that illustrious family, as the
28th in descent from Oilioll Olum, the common ancestor of the
Mac Carthys, O’Briens, and other princely families of Munster.
According to the Annals of Innisfallen, which are the
best authority for the history of Munster, the first Mac Con
Mara was elected to be chief head of the tribe of O’Coilean
in 1313: and again, at the year 1315, it is stated that
Macnamara, and Mahon the son of Cumea, went to the
tower of De Clare to compel him to enter into an agreement,
which De Clare acceded to, to give Mac Con and his
heirs the canthred of Ua Caissin, the charters whereof had
been given to De Clare. The second Mac Con, to whom as I
conceive this seal should be assigned, and who was grandson
to the former, became chief of Hy-Caissin about the year
1340, and died about ten years afterwards.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">SOME ACCOUNT OF AN IRISH DARE-DEVIL.</h2>

<p>People may talk about the idleness and indolence of Irishmen,
but in my mind they merely betray their ignorance in so
doing. Positively there is no other country on the face of the
earth, the inhabitants of which have wrought out for themselves
so many different professions, occupations, and ingenious
expedients, to make the time pass agreeably: let any change
in the constitution of society require the exercise of any particular
faculty for good or for evil, and straightway the vacancy
is filled up with an expedition and efficiency truly wonderful.
Astounding as the proposition may sound to the wise men and
women of the empire, the fact is, that Irishmen hate idleness;
it is an intolerable load to them; they are ever on the look-out
for something to do; and as all parties concede to them the
possession of almost infallible ingenuity, it would be strange
indeed, if, in a spot of land so fertile in adventure, any one of
them should be long at fault in such a pursuit.</p>

<p>That the occupations upon which they occasionally fix, in
their amiable detestation of idleness, are not always the best
calculated to promote the well-being or comforts of the rest
of the community, I am quite free to confess; but this is all
matter of taste, and does not at all interfere with the validity of
my argument, which merely seeks to assert that an Irishman will
do anything sooner than be doing nothing. To be sure they
have their propensities, among the most favourite of which are
fighting, farming, and love-making; but should any untoward
obstacle prevent their indulgence in any of these tastes, they by
no means sink into an apathetic despondency like many of their
neighbours: they have too many resources for that, upon some
one of which they immediately fall back with as much zeal and
energy as if it had been the original occupation of their choice.
Nor are they fastidious: in the generality of cases it is quite
immaterial to them whether they are practising gunnery upon
a denounced landlord, or figuring in a procession: they are
ready for anything, good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;anything but
idleness. It was said of old that were you to put an Irishman
on the spit, you would not long be at a loss for another to turn
it. Whoever he was that first propounded that maxim, certes
he knew our nation well; nay, I would venture to say that
in ninety-nine cases an Irishman would roast his mother, if
driven to that melancholy alternative, sooner than remain
either idle or inactive. Joking apart, I wish those who
grumble most about Ireland would give us something to do,
and find for us some rational occupation which might obviate
the daily occurrence of those little extravagances of conduct
which render our people a puzzle and a wonder to better regulated
communities.</p>

<p>Such a state of society as this, and such restless activity
alone, could give birth to the extraordinary character whose
turbulent career I am about inditing; but ere I proceed, it
would perhaps be well to allude to the circumstances and
emergencies which, on the principles I have laid down, threw
such an individual to the surface. Little more than allusion
will be necessary; for in these days, when so much has been
said and sung about Ireland&mdash;while Carleton in his soul-searching
tales anatomises the very inmost heart of our countrymen,
and Mrs Hall skims the surface of all that is good
and beautiful amongst us&mdash;while attorneys make fortunes,
and lawyers found families, who can be ignorant of the lamentable
mismanagement of property which has beggared so
many of our oldest families? The history of one will almost
tell the fate of them all. Incumbrances accumulating for perhaps
half-a-dozen generations, some probably long before discharged,
but still allowed to remain on record as if unpaid,
through mere neglect and carelessness, until the fact of their
ever having been paid falls into oblivion, or becomes incapable
of proof; others permitted to continue, in the hope that some
lucky accident would some time or other, and somehow or
other, transfer them by inheritance to the heir, or else enable
him to liquidate them more conveniently than at the present.
At last, in the changes of mortal affairs, they fall into the hands
of strangers or persons who must have their own. A settlement
is demanded&mdash;the inheritor finds himself fifty per cent
worse than nothing&mdash;redemption is out of the question&mdash;he
plunges into tenfold dissipation and extravagance, knowing
that he wastes nothing which it is in his power to retain or
retrieve. A short life and a merry one, is his maxim; to
protract it, he litigates every claim right and left&mdash;seeks to
baffle every process of the law&mdash;calls his tenantry to his assistance&mdash;while
they, taking advantage of his distresses, and
the confusion of all rights, assume an independent position,
playing off the landlord and his adversaries against one another&mdash;now
rebelling against his weak claims&mdash;now affording
him protection against the advances of the law, throwing their
weight into whatever scale promises the most fun and the most
advantage&mdash;half-a-dozen bailiffs are maimed or murdered&mdash;half-a-dozen
examples are made to the offended dignity of justice.
Affairs come to their crisis at last in spite of all opposition.
The attorneys get their costs&mdash;the creditors get the
surplus&mdash;the unfortunate debtor gets the turn-out&mdash;and so ends
an old song and an old family.</p>

<p>This terrible ultimatum of the law did not, however, in all
cases put an end to the hopes and energies of the discomfited
litigant. Another card still remained to be played, by any
one reckless and desperate enough to avail himself of it: this
was no less than to rise in open opposition to all law, set the
sheriff and his subalterns at defiance, and hold possession
with a strong hand after the manner of the ancients. Before
matters came to this, the tenantry were usually, from the
causes I have mentioned, sufficiently demoralized for any purpose;
and whatever might have been their previous conduct,
those sympathies which seldom fail a ruined master, were of
course roused to their highest pitch; in addition to which
stimulant, it was manifestly their advantage that the reign of
misrule should continue, so that, when a man was thus turned
at bay, there was no saying how the matter might end. I believe
it very often happened, during the weak and uncertain
administration of justice in the past century, that a pertinacious
adherence to this desperate line of policy has tired out
the persecution of all adversaries, and been crowned with final
success. Any money, therefore, for a partizan able and willing
to undertake the support of such a desperate cause; one
who, while his principal kept in the background, had no fear
or shame to prevent him from putting himself forward&mdash;drilling
the tenants&mdash;collecting adherents and information&mdash;concentrating
all the lawlessness of the district against the operations
of the law&mdash;holding his own life at nought, and the lives
of all others at a lower standard, if possible.</p>

<p>In those days society required Dare-devils, and if old stories
be true, Dare-devils galore arose to supply the want. But
what were they all to Mick Connell of Thurles? The desperado
whose name is still remembered with terror and admiration
through the district which was the scene of his turbulent
career fifty years ago, was, as my informant described him to
me, a man of the most indomitable resolution, endowed with
a strength of body truly formidable, though of small stature
and mean appearance, and withal one of the most mortal opponents
of the king’s writ that ever figured, even in Tipperary.
This fellow was not slow to perceive that a more pleasing and
profitable occupation could be found for the exercise of the daring
qualities which he possessed, than was afforded in the occasional
outbreak at fair or pattern, to which he had hitherto
in his simplicity restricted himself. A gentleman in the neighbourhood
got into difficulties, and, poor man, had not a soul
belonging to him who could direct the laudable exertions his
tenants and followers were willing to make in his behalf, or show
them how even to dispose of a bailiff. Common humanity induced
Mick to come forward, and never was an act of humanity more
richly rewarded. The most brilliant and unexpected success
crowned his labours. Under his guidance the tenants became
a phalanx, able to bother the twelve judges themselves, or tire
the patience even of a Chancery suit. Writs were sent out, but
had no return, and now and then the same might be said
of the bailiffs who ventured to bear them. Everything was
reduced to the most perfect system; and the attorneys, dismayed
and discomfited, declared themselves conquered by a
line of tactics hitherto unknown, the discoverer of which deserved
to be immortalized. The result was, that the party who
had been so fortunate as to awaken for his service the slumbering
energies of this determined partizan, was allowed an
honourable capitulation, while the discovery of these happy
improvements in the noble art of self-defence gained for Connell
himself the character of public benefactor of all distressed
country gentlemen.</p>

<p>His fame increased, and business came thick upon him.
Many a man who was half inclined to die soft before, without
one effort to save himself, took courage now, and hastened to
avail himself of the prowess and protection of this new and
unhoped-for auxiliary; until, at length, in all desperate cases
the first step taken was to secure his services. In process of
time his sons grew to manhood, fitted in every respect to co-operate
with such a father; and of course the extent and
boldness of his operations increased along with his family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
The local authorities connived at him; many of them probably
having received the benefit of his assistance already, while the
rest of them knew not what day would fling them upon his
protection. Touch Connell!&mdash;they would as soon touch the
apples of their own eyes; they might as well yield themselves
at once to the hated touch of the bailiffs. Gratitude for past
services, and a prudent view to those which he might ere long
be called to render, procured him an immunity from the harassing
regulations which were made for the control of gentlemen
of his kidney; and, accordingly, under this reciprocal patronage
he grew and flourished, and waxed famous. Gradually
he became enabled to form a gang, and, that point gained, he
became irresistible. The beauty and simplicity of his system
caused it to triumph every where. Debts were at a discount&mdash;judgments
were condemned&mdash;incumbrances ceased to be a
burden&mdash;and, alas for the mutability of mortal greatness, the
sheriff, the very sheriff, was so lightly regarded that not a soul
in the place would be bothered bribing him!</p>

<p>Respectable and remunerative as his line of business had
become, it was not long until a wider field was opened to his
increased powers, and the experience he had accumulated.
The representative of an old and considerable family was
threatened with an ejectment by some of his relatives, who
possessed a clearer claim to the property than he did; while, in
addition to the doubtfulness of his cause, he had to bemoan
that the improvident manner in which he lived had deprived
him of the means necessary to defend it. Nor were his troubles
confined to one law-suit. Other parties, conceiving their
rights were as feasible as those of his original adversary, determined
on a similar assertion of them, and on one day the
luckless wight was served with, I believe, no less than four
ejectments. I suppose every body is aware of the indiscretions,
irregularities, and extravagances which in that facetious
process are alleged against the person whom it seeks to disturb.
I need not, therefore, say with what amazement the
poor man perused the weighty charges of assault and battery
so circumstantially laid against him, or how deeply he puzzled
his memory in ransacking it to discover when he could, by any
possibility, have committed all these outrages. And who the
deuce was John Thrustout, that seemed mixed up so much in
the transaction?&mdash;he was a civil fellow, anyhow, for he warned
him fairly of his danger, and advised him to make the best
fight he could. “And, by the powers, so I will,” he ejaculated;
“since they say we wallopped them, I may as well have
the gains as the name&mdash;let them do their best. If Mike Connell
helps me, I’ll take the hint, and maybe they won’t have
truth on their side the next time they complain of me.”</p>

<p>It usually happens that where a great many people are endeavouring
each to get a blow at one unfortunate, he against
whom this united ill will is directed comes off pretty safe in the
scramble. In Ireland, at all events, the luxury of thrashing
one’s neighbour is so highly prized, that one can bear no interference
when enjoying it, and thus a well-meaning auxiliary
in the grateful occupation is likely to fall in for worse
treatment than was originally intended for the first victim.
So it was in the present instance. The discordant interests
of the different claimants bred such confusion and disturbance
in the several suits instituted, that for a long time the poor
wretch whom all sought to disinherit was left in comparative
quiet, and leisure was afforded him to overcome the scruples
which Connell raised when it was first proposed to him to undertake
the piece of unheard-of atrocity required of him, no less,
in fact, than to place himself in direct and open outlawry, by
seizing possession of the property in dispute, and holding it by
force of arms against all comers. But the bribe was too large,
and the adventure altogether too tempting, notwithstanding its
concomitant perils, for Connell’s virtue or prudence to persist
in refusing; so, casting aside all minor matters as unworthy
of the bright prospects now opening before him, he gathered
his troop of brigands, strengthened it with some new hands,
cleared it of all doubtful characters, and, to use a transatlantic
term, squatted in full force on the disputed territory, dividing its
richest farms between himself and his followers, as the price
of his and their services.</p>

<p>Weary on these law-suits!&mdash;terminate as they may, they invariably
end by sucking away the very life-blood of the fools
who rush into them. In the case to which I allude, the unfortunate
defendant had not the poor satisfaction of living to see
the discomfiture which he had prepared for his assailants.
The daily watch for ruin, still deferred, was to him as sickening
as ever was the watch for hope under like circumstances;
and he died ere it came, leaving his curse among his adversaries
on an average, and his strong injunction to Connell to
hold out against them all&mdash;an injunction he was by no means
inclined to disobey; for, now that he had undertaken the job,
he was as eager to see out the fun as if he had himself originally
concocted it, not to speak of the snug homesteads which
he and his gang possessed on the sole tenure of their resistance
to all intruders. Accordingly, no sooner had he disposed
of the mortal remains of his defunct employer, than he betook
himself with almost religious zeal to obey his behests, by
strengthening himself against the storm which he foresaw
would soon burst upon him. The mansion-house was a strong
substantial building, and there, with a judgment that would
have been creditable to the most eminent general who ever
conquered on a field of battle, he removed his head-quarters,
and proceeded to lay in such stores of food, arms, and ammunition
as would enable him to meet the danger in a manner
worthy of the stake he was playing for. It is needless
to paint the dismay which these bold arrangements scattered
through the camps of the various claimants, who thus,
at the very moment when each congratulated himself upon the
immediate prospect of snatching the prize which the operation
of nature, anticipating that of law, had thrown into his hands,
found this unexpected and formidable opponent start up in
their path, with his audacious pretensions, so audaciously, but
at the same time so seriously supported. Had there been
anything like confidence among them, their co-operation might
probably have effected his expulsion; but it was not without
reason that the cunning freebooter reckoned upon their mutual
distrust precluding the possibility of such a coalition.
Each of course sought to make terms with him; and with
each, of course, he coquetted as naturally as if he had been
bred, born, and reared in the best society, but in vain each
importuned him to give up the possession&mdash;to all such demands
he returned the same modest answer, “Truly it would not become
an ignorant simple man like him to pretend to settle a
question which puzzled the judges themselves. As soon as the
rightful owner was declared, he would be ready to quit in his
favour; but until then, it was his duty to keep all out with perfect
impartiality.”</p>

<p>One of the parties whose demands were thus evaded, happened
to be a wrongheaded, positive sort of customer of the
old school, who viewed the power and decisions of the wigged
brotherhood with almost as much contempt as Connell himself
could regard them, and being too impatient to await the slow
and sinuous progress of the law, undertook the desperate resolution
of forcing that redoubted personage to evacuate, even
by force of arms. It never was a hard matter in Tipperary,
when a rookawn was on foot, to gather auxiliaries; and at
the time of which I write, the facilities were perhaps more
numerous than ever; not even the formidable character of the
garrison and its commander could deter numbers of the adventurous
spirits of that famed region from the enterprize.
They entered into the spirit of the thing with heart and soul;
and, accordingly, one fine morning, with a goodly band at his
heels, and prepared with all the needful appliances, this old-fashioned
vindicator of his rights set out to storm the stronghold.
It is unnecessary to say that an awful riot ensued&mdash;barricades
were broken down, outposts driven in, houses wrecked,
and numbers of his then majesty’s subjects wofully maltreated;
until at length, in spite of all opposition, they reached the house,
than which even valour’s self could no further go. Scaling-ladders
and battering-rams were in requisition; the fun began
to thicken, and the result to grow doubtful. Saragossa was
not more nobly defended, nor Badajos more gallantly assailed.
It is possible, however, to push a joke too far, even on the best
tempered people; and Connell, feeling that this was the case,
determined to give a gentle intimation of it to his assailants.
A large window had been burst in and ladders placed against
the breach&mdash;a rush was made to ascend them in defiance of
the threats which he denounced against whoever should attempt
it, and which he executed by pouring a discharge of
fire-arms into the very thickest of the mass. But it was
too late to intimidate; the enraged mob rushed over the
bodies of the fallen&mdash;a simultaneous attack was made upon
all points&mdash;and, alas for the brave, the post was won. In
the melée that ensued, all escaped but the leader; and before
the relatives of the slain, or the general mass of the victorious
party, were aware of his capture, he was judiciously hurried
out of their reach, and handed over to the civil power on
a charge of murder. There is no part of the world, however,
in which the distinction between killing and murder was so
well understood as in Ireland in those days; and in point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
fact, I believe the man was free from the <em>legal</em> charge&mdash;at
least so it appeared to the jury who tried him, for he was acquitted.
Short-lived, indeed, was the triumph of his adversaries,
and immediately on his liberation they began to tremble
for the security of their tenure. He had sworn that though
it should cost him his life, he would endeavour to recover the premises
of which he had been dispossessed, and they knew him too
well to doubt him: a council of war was held, and the question
proposed, should the place be defended or evacuated? The latter
alternative was adopted, not without good reason; but it
was likewise determined that it should never again afford
such protection to Connell as it had, or present an obstacle to
the entry of the legitimate claimant, when fortune should so
far favour him; and in pursuance of this policy the stately
mansion was levelled to the ground&mdash;house and offices, even to
the walled enclosures, every spot that could again harbour a
freebooter.</p>

<p>But it was not so easy to baffle that indefatigable customer:
half of his resources were not yet expended; his followers, reanimated
by his escape, gathered round him again; and before
his dismayed antagonists recovered from their disappointment,
he was strongly and securely entrenched in an earthen fort
of his own construction, in which he displayed as much science
and foresight as would have done credit to Carnôt. This
was the period of his highest triumph: his insolence became
unbounded; and he used, I am informed, to stalk through the
streets of Thurles, on the most public occasions, armed to the
teeth, and defying the best man in the town “to lay a wet
finger on him.” It is not to be supposed that these extraordinary
proceedings could fail of reaching the ears of the high
functionaries who were called upon to decide upon the rights
of the rival claimants, and who, not regarding Connell as the
very fittest person to undertake the care of the litigated property,
ordered him to be instantaneously dispossessed, and
forwarded writs to that purport to the sheriff. That officer,
no way astray as to the dangers and difficulties he should encounter
in any attempt to dislodge such a desperado, collected
as much of the civil and military force of the district as
was available, and proceeded to execute his perilous behest.
Of course he was resisted, and it was soon found that the
most violent measures should be resorted to. An order was
given to storm the fort, and the attempt was answered by a
volley from within, that tumbled a couple of the assailants,
and drove back the remainder. The conflict became deadly,
but so securely were the banditti posted, that all the efforts
of the besiegers made scarce any impression upon them: cannon
alone could be effectual, and a dispatch was sent for it.
In the meantime a general assault was given, with partial
success, which seemed to dishearten Connell so far us that he
attempted a sortie for the purpose of escaping. Two of his
sons fell in the melée, but all the rest of the party succeeded
in getting off, leaving some half dozen of the assailants half
dead or dying. He was now, undoubtedly, within the reach
of the law, and warrants were issued for his apprehension;
but for a long time no one dared to attempt executing them,
notwithstanding that very large rewards were offered. At
length, a bailiff who had some private pique against him, to
act as an additional stimulant, undertook the dangerous enterprize&mdash;succeeded
in dogging him to his retreat, and on his
attempting to snatch a pistol to defend himself, shot him
through the head, and put an end to the career of a real Irish
Dare-Devil.</p>

<p class="right">A. M’C.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Perverse Conduct of Man.</span>&mdash;Among the many properties
of human nature which almost exceed comprehension, comes
the parsimony of the rich and the extravagance of the poor.
Some rich men spare to-day, as if they feared starving tomorrow,
and the indigent often consume in an hour what they
may feel the want of for a week. These properties are the
more unaccountable, because parsimony is chiefly found to
predominate in aged people, who may expect death every day,
and extravagance chiefly in the young, who may reasonably
hope to live many years; as if old people hoard money because
they cannot want it, and young ones throw it away
because it is necessary to their subsistence.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Friends and Enemies.</span>&mdash;While we value the praise of our
friends, we should not despise the censures of our enemies;
as from the malice of the latter we frequently learn our faults,
which the partiality of the former led them to overlook or
conceal.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Ghosts Everywhere.</span>&mdash;Could anything be more miraculous
than an actual authentic ghost? The English Johnson
longed, all his life, to see one, but could not, though he went
to Cock-lane, and thence to the church-vaults, and tapped on
coffins. Foolish doctor! Did he never, with the mind’s eye, as
well as with the body’s, look round him into that full tide of
human life he so loved? did he never so much as look into himself?
The good doctor was a ghost, as actual and authentic as
heart could wish; well nigh a million of ghosts were travelling
the streets by his side. Sweep away the illusion of time;
compress the three-score years into three minutes: what else
was he&mdash;what else are we? Are we not spirits, shaped into
a body, into an appearance, and that fade away again into
air and invisibility? This is no metaphor; it is a simple scientific
<em>fact</em>: we start out of nothingness, take figure, and are
apparitions; round us, as round the veriest spectre, is eternity;
and to eternity minutes are as years and æons. Where
now is Alexander of Macedon?&mdash;does the steel host that
yelled in fierce battle-shouts at Issus and Arbela remain behind
him: or have they all vanished utterly, even as perturbed
goblins must? Napoleon too, and his Moscow retreats and
Austerlitz campaigns&mdash;was it all other than the veriest spectre-hunt,
which has now, with its howling tumult that made
night hideous, flitted away? Ghosts!&mdash;there are nigh a
thousand millions walking the earth openly at noontide; some
half-hundred have vanished from it, some half-hundred have
arisen in it, ere thy watch ticks once. Generation after generation
takes to itself the form of a body, and, forth issuing
from Cimmerian night on heaven’s mission, <span class="smcapuc">APPEARS</span>. What
force and fire is in each he expends: one grinding in the
mill of industry; one, hunter-like, climbing the giddy Alpine
heights of science; one madly dashed in pieces on the rocks
of strife, in war with his fellow; and then the heaven-sent is
recalled; his earthly vesture falls away, and soon even to
sense becomes a vanished shadow. Thus, like some wild-flaming,
wild-thundering train of heaven’s artillery, does this
mysterious mankind thunder and flame, in long-drawn, quick-succeeding
grandeur, through the unknown deep. Thus, like
a God-created, fire-breathing spirit-host, we emerge from
the Inane, haste stormfully across the astonished earth, then
plunge again into the Inane. But whence? Oh, heaven,
whither? Sense knows not; faith knows not, only that it is
through mystery to mystery, from God and to God.&mdash;<cite>Carlyle’s
Essays.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The Metropolis.</span>&mdash;London in length is nearly 8 miles,
its breadth 3, and its circumference 26. It contains above
8,000 streets, lanes, alleys, and courts, and more than 65 different
squares. It has 246 churches and chapels, 207 meeting
houses for Dissenters, 43 chapels for foreigners, and 6
synagogues for Jews&mdash;making 502 places of public worship.
The number of inhabitants during the sitting of Parliament
is estimated at 1,250,000. In this vast city there are upwards
of 4,000 seminaries for education, 10 institutions for promoting
the arts and sciences, 122 asylums for the indigent, 17
for the sick and lame, 13 dispensaries, 704 charitable institutions,
58 courts of justice, 7,040 professional men connected
with the various departments of the law. There are 13,300
vessels trading to the river Thames in the course of a year,
and 40,000 waggons going and returning to the metropolis in
the same period, including their repeated voyages. The
amount of exports and imports to and from the Thames is estimated
at £66,811,922 sterling annually, and the property
floating in this vast city every year is £170,000,000 sterling.
These circumstances may be sufficient to convince us of the
amazing extent and importance of the capital of the British
empire.</p>

<p class="gap4">No person can be happy without friends. The heart is
formed for love, and cannot be satisfied without the opportunity
of giving and receiving affection. If we love others, they
will love us; and in order to have friends, we must show ourselves
friendly. Hence it is every one’s duty to cultivate a
cheerful and obliging disposition. It is impossible to be
happy without it.</p>

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
